# Urdu_Sign_Interpreter
 According to research, there are 2 billion people on this earth have some form of hearing impairment, and statistically, eight out of 
100 people are born mute. Those people have to rely on sign language in their daily lives. Resultantly, in
my fourth year of undergraduate I started a startup to eradicate the communication barrier between 
ordinary and deaf-mute people, and I tried to be their voice. It was an interpreter to convert the 
Pakistan sign language of deaf-mute people to Urdu text and voice. I won several national-level prizes 
for my startup in Pakistan and presented my startup at International conferences.
